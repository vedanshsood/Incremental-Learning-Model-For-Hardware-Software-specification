# Incremental-Learning-Model-For-Hardware-Software-specification
This is a Incremental/Online Learning model for predicting commands to be hardware/software related.
Online learning refers to training a model with some amount of data and uploading it on server and with every time stamp re-training the model with new data either on the server or on our machine and reuploading the model on server.

This is a very basic model to understand the terms and process of making Online Learning model. In this model the test data is added in the end to the training data to improve the accuracy of our Naive-bayes model.
We use River Module for online learning model.
